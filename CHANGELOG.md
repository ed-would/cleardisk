# ClearDisk - Change Log

All notable changes to ClearDisk are documented here.

## [1.8.3] - Unreleased
### Changed
- Universal binary for Apple Silicon and Intel (`arm64` + `x86_64` via `lipo`)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-16
### Added
- Added signed app produced pipeline to avoid `xattr -cr ...` quirk
- Updated version derivation from scripts

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-13
### Fixed
- **No menu bar icon; the app appears to do nothing** (#22, #16). `NSApplication.delegate` is a *weak* reference, and nothing else in the app retained `AppDelegate` — every other reference to it captured `self` weakly. Held only by a local in `main()`, ARC was free to release it after its last use, before or during `app.run()`, taking the status item and the popover with it. The process kept running (some users still saw notification banners) but there was no menu bar icon and clicks went nowhere. Whether it happened at all depended on the optimiser, which is why it reproduced on some Macs and not others. The delegate is now held for the life of the process.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Project scanner expanded from 11 to 23 project types** — Python, CocoaPods, Carthage, Xcode, .NET/C#, Godot, Unity, Unreal, Haskell, Elixir, Zig, Crystal, plus the modern JS caches (`.next`, `.nuxt`, `.svelte-kit`, `.angular`, `.turbo`, `.vite`, `.yarn/cache`). A project now lists each of its caches as a separate row.
- **Cleanup history** — every cleaned project cache is logged (what, where, how big, when) and can be reviewed or cleared from the Projects tab.
- **Failed cleans are now reported.** If a directory cannot be moved to the Trash, the app says so — and offers to open Full Disk Access settings when the cause is permissions.

### Fixed
- **Phantom savings**: a clean whose `trashItem` failed still reported "Recovered X!", credited the savings and wrote a history entry, while the files were untouched on disk. Only bytes that actually reach the Trash are counted now, measured from disk rather than assumed.
- **Unclickable UI after reopening the popover**: presenting a `.sheet` from inside a `.transient` NSPopover strands SwiftUI's presentation state when the popover auto-closes on focus loss. The project sheets are drawn inside the popover now, and every modal is torn down when the popover closes.
- **Duplicate artifact rows**: a directory matching two project types (a Unity project is also a .NET project; a JS+Python monorepo shares `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`) was listed once per type, double-counting its size and failing the second clean. Each directory is surfaced once.
- **Data-loss guards**: `env/`, `venv/`, `.venv/` are only ever offered when a real virtualenv is proven (`pyvenv.cfg` / `bin/activate`), and Crystal's `lib/` only when a `shard.lock` proves `shards install` ran. Unity `Builds/` and Unreal `Saved/` are no longer touched — those are user output, not caches.
- The large-file scanner no longer looks inside media library packages (`.photoslibrary`, `.fcpbundle`, `.imovielibrary`, …), where deleting a single file corrupts the whole library.

### Changed
- The version is declared once, in `CHANGELOG.md`, baked into the bundle by `scripts/build_app.sh`, and read back at runtime.
- Project cache actions use the same trash icon as the Developer tab — they perform the same destructive action.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-18
### Added

- **Cloud CLIs**: AWS CLI SSO cache (`~/.aws/sso/cache`)
- Total cache paths increased from 44 to 63

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-05
### Added

### Changed
- Refactored cache path definitions into single source of truth (no more duplication between devCachePaths and scanDevCaches)

### Fixed

- Developer tab simplified — buttons removed from header (moved to hero card sub-screens)
- DMG now includes Applications shortcut for drag-to-install

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-02
### Added
- **Project Artifacts Scanner** — New "Projects" tab finds stale `node_modules`, `target/`, `.build/`, `build/`, `vendor/` directories inside your project folders. Inspired by kondo (2,200⭐) and npkill (9,100⭐)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-02
### Added
- **Cache Descriptions**: Every cache item now shows a human-readable description explaining what it is and whether it's safe to delete (inspired by npkill's 301-line description file)
- **DerivedData Project Breakdown**: Xcode DerivedData entry now shows which projects are inside (e.g. "MyApp: 2.3 GB, OtherApp: 1.1 GB") by reading each subfolder's `info.plist → WorkspacePath` (technique from DevCleaner)
- **Xcode Running Check**: When cleaning Xcode-related caches, a warning appears if Xcode is currently running ("Close Xcode first for best results")
- **Competitor Analysis**: 5 open-source competitors analyzed (DevCleaner, XcodeCleaner-SwiftUI, kondo, npkill, mac-cleanup-py) — insights applied to ClearDisk

### Changed

- Confirmation dialogs now include Xcode running warning when applicable
- Tooltips on path line show full cache description on hover

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-01

- **Quick Action Bar**: "Clean X safe caches (Y GB)" one-click button in hero card
- **Visual Category Bars**: Color-coded proportional bars in Overview tab (each category gets unique color)
- **Recovery Banner**: Green "Recovered X GB!" banner appears for 5 seconds after any cleanup
- **Cumulative Savings**: Persistent "Total saved: X GB" counter in footer (survives app restart)
- **Onboarding Screen**: First-launch welcome overlay with feature list and notification permission status
- **Permission Checking**: Tracks notification permission state and inaccessible cache paths
- **Permission Banner**: Warning banner when notifications are denied or paths unreadable
- **Bundle Guard**: App no longer crashes when run via `swift run` (gracefully disables notifications)

### Changed

- Hero card replaced the small "X cleanable" row with a prominent dashboard
- Footer shows "Total saved" when user has cleaned anything, version number otherwise
- `build_app.sh` now uses relative path (works from any directory)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Safe Delete (Trash)**: All cache cleaning now moves files to Trash instead of permanent delete
  - Users can recover files for 30 days before Trash is emptied
  - Fallback to removeItem only if trashItem fails (permission issue)
  - "Empty Trash" still permanently deletes (as expected)
- **Risk Levels**: Each developer cache now has a risk indicator
  - 🟢 Safe — can be rebuilt with a single command (DerivedData, npm, pip, brew, etc.)

  - 🔴 Risky — may contain irreplaceable data (Docker data)
  - Risk emoji shown next to each cache name in UI
  - Confirmation dialogs now show risk description
  - "Clean All" dialog warns about risky caches

  - "Not used for X days" badge on each cache entry
  - ⚠️ red suggestion for caches >90 days old and >1GB

- **Smart menu bar text**: Shows free space normally, shows cleanable amount with ♻️ when disk ≥80%
- **macOS notifications**: Alert when disk reaches 80% or 90%, with cleanable amount in notification

- **"Clean All" button**: One-click button to clean all developer caches at once (with confirmation dialog)
- Large file threshold lowered to 100MB (was 500MB) — catches more files

### Fixed

- Quick cleanup actions: clean dev cache, empty trash, reveal in Finder
- 3 tabs: Overview, Developer, Large Files
- Color-coded storage bar (blue/orange/red by usage level)
- Confirmation alerts before destructive actions

### Roadmap (from QA.md research)
- v1.1: Storage forecast (disk full prediction), smart suggestions based on file age
- NOT planned: Sunburst/treemap (DaisyDisk niche), auto scheduler (trust issue), duplicate finder (crowded space)
